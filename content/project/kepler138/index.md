Animated Zoom-In of How Kepler is Revolutionizing the Understanding of the Relationship between Planet's Masses &amp; Radii: The animation shows the mass-radius diagram based on measurements of 127 exoplanets. The video begins by shows planets with masses similar to Jupiter and slowly zooms towards small masses and radii to display a comparison of the physical properties of the Kepler-138 planets relative to Earth, Venus, Mars and Mercury.
