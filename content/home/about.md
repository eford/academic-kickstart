# Biography

For centuries, theories of planet formation had been designed to explain the planets orbiting our Sun. Since the 1990's, astronomers have discovered several hundred extrasolar planets orbiting other solar-type stars and thousands of additional planets and planet candidates from NASA's [Kepler mission](http://kepler.nasa.gov). There are several striking differences between the known extrasolar planets and the planets in our Solar System. Thus, the discovery of extrasolar planets has provided many opportunities for improving our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems.

My research centers around exoplanets, with long-term goals of improving our understanding planet formation and the dynamical evolution of planetary systems.  My research group includes both theoretical modeling of planetary systems and interpretation of exoplanet observations. I emphasize the interface between theory and observation, including techniques for characterizing extrasolar planets, the statistical analysis of extrasolar planet observations, methodology for exoplanet demographics, and the efficient design of extrasolar planet surveys. I collaborate with leading planet survey teams, including NASA's Kepler mission, the [Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF)](http://hpf.psu.edu/) and [NEID](http://neid.psu.edu/).  Ultimately, my research aims to improve our understanding of planet formation & evolution, both in our Solar System and in general.
