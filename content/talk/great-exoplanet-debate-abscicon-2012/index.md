abstract = "Astrobiology Magazine recently hosted a Great Exoplanet Debate during the 2012 Astrobiology Science Conference (AbSciCon 2012) in Atlanta, Georgia. The panelists were David Grinspoon, Sara Seager, Dirk Schulze-Makuch, Vikki, and Eric Ford of the University of Florida.  <br /><br /> The panel of experts discussed questions such as:  What should the priorities be in the search for planets in the galaxy? How accurate can we be in identifying habitable, Earth-like worlds around distant stars using current technology? Rather than focusing solely on Earth-like planets, should the discussion be expanded to ask where we can find habitable planets?"
