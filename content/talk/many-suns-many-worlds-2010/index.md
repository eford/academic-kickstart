Astronomers have confirmed that 490 planets (and counting!) have been discovered outside our solar system. There may be billions of these _exoplanets_ inhabiting the Milky Way alone. What do these discoveries, if anything, tell us about our place in the universe? <br /><br />The Planetary Society, the American Astronomical Society's Division of Planetary Sciences, and the Keck Institute for Space Studies invite you to _Many Suns, Many Worlds: The Galactic Quest for Exoplanets,_ a free event on Monday, October 04, 2010 at Caltech in Pasadena. Four leading experts in the field will review how exoplanets form, the latest techniques used to go exoplanet hunting, and how to determine what type of exoplanet has been found."
