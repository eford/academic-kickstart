# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "For centuries, human understanding of planetary systems was informed by only a single example, our own. With the discovery of planetary systems around distant stars, astronomers have uncovered a surprising diversity of planets and recognized that many basic properties of our solar system are not universal. In 2009, NASA's Kepler mission began searching for Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. Ford will share the challenges and highlights of this mission, plus how its discoveries are reshaping our understanding of the origins of our solar system."
